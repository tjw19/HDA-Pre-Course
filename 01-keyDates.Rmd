# Term Dates and Time Requirements

The Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning MSc is a full-time, in-person one-year course. You must be in London and attend class during all of the HDA Term Dates.

During Term 1 and Term 2, classes will take place between 9:30am and 5pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (exact times vary depending on the module). Wednesdays will either have a lecture in the morning, optional short courses, or time for independent study. Term 3 is a full-time research project where you will still be required to be in London, but will be allowed a 2 week vacation (this is in additional to the time off in between terms). All exams and presentations are held in person.
