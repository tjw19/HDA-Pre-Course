# Mandatory Training

Once you are enrolled as an Imperial student, you will have a series of short mandatory training exercises to complete.

## Data Protection Awareness

The conduct of most epidemiology and public health research requires collection, storage, and processing of personal data. As a controller for most of the personal data it processes, Imperial College London is committed to full compliance with the applicable data protection legislation, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.

As you may handle personal and sensitive personal data through teaching and research activities, you are required to complete a **Data Protection Awareness** e-learning course, which includes best practice and scenarios for maintaining data security, an overview of the data protection regulations, compliance, rights and enforcement. 

You can only complete the course once you are enrolled as an Imperial student, and are encouraged to complete it before the course commences. Once you have enrolled with Imperial, you can access and complete the **Data Protection Awareness** course on Blackboard Learn. Instructions for course enrolment are outlined on [Imperial Essentials](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff-development/courses-and-programmes/online-learning/e-learning-courses/data-protection/) 


## Plagiarism Awareness

As an Imperial College London student, you will be required to use and share academic information ethically, with academic integrity and in accordance with [Imperial College's Examination & Assessment: Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/registry/academic-governance/public/academic-policy/academic-integrity/Examination-and-assessments---academic-integrity.pdf).

To support compliance with this policy, you are required to complete a [Plagiarism Awareness Course](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/masters-students/plagiarism-online/), developed by the Graduate School in conjunction with the Library. It aims to equip all Imperial postgraduate students with a working knowledge of the concept of plagiarism and how to avoid it. 
You should be auto-enrolled to this course; instructions for manual enrolment are also on the College website.
